    description: I worked ‘Integrated Water Resources Management Project (IWRM)’ project (Both in phase 1 & 2) jointly implemented by the Swiss Red Cross, financed by Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation SDC. Within my job responsibilities, I have developed 26 methodologies, tools, formats for ground water monitoring and project monitoring purposes, and guided staff for efficient use. Also, I have designed, conducted, and analyzed baseline, midline, and endline surveys for the annual internal evaluations. Hence, I’ve collected and preserved data in periodic output and outcome-focused monitoring databases and documented it with reports of water resources, ongoing activities, feedbacks, and outcomes of the project regularly. I established the project’s MIS system that supported institutionalizing the water quality monitoring system at local government institutions. Prepared three annual and three half-yearly outcome-focused operational reports. I designed and conducted 38 categories of surveys using ODK and KoBo Toolbox, monitored the progress of ongoing activities, and assessed the impact of the project intervention. I analyzed data for reports using Excel, SPSS, ArcGIS, and suitable tools for the specific type of data.  I also prepared 4 monitoring guidelines and 3 working manuals for field staff.  I also provided information to the management and implementation team to make decisions and mitigation the situation and contributed to knowledge management and monitoring system. The remarkable study I have done in this period are – installing 150 managed aquifer recharge (MAR) and rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems, installing 08 Rugged TROLL 100 and Rugged BaroTROLL Data Loggers, cost-benefit analysis (CBA), water footprint, economic valuation of water, web-based water resources mapping as a management tool and water modelling for empirically identifying water stressed area.
