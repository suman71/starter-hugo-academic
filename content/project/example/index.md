The aim of the IWRM project is to improve the well-being of people by means of promoting 
coordinated, equitable and sustainable development and management of water, land and related 
resources. In Bangladesh the enabling environment for inducing the paradigm shift from sectoral 
management of water resources to holistic and integrated management of water resources has been 
created by the enactment of the Bangladesh Water Act (BWA), 2013. The IWRM project has two 
complimentary sub-components; the national component and the sub-national component. The former 
is being implemented by a govt. department under the Ministry of Water Resources, Water Resources 
Planning Organisation (WARPO), and the sub-national component is being implemented by Swiss 
Red Cross and DASCOH. The national component’s focus is to further develop the regulatory 
framework and operationalize institutional mechanisms foreseen in the BWA, 2013. The sub-national 
component, on the other hand, intends to achieve the following:
* Bring about changes in role, practice and attitudes of water related asset owners and users 
through design and subsequent application of an incentive based regulatory system. This will 
include reward/recognition/rebate for improved water management practices adopted by 
HHs/community and Local Governance Institutions (LGIs)
* Enable different actors to understand and practice the principle of subsidiarity related to 
IWRM. The will mean that stronger regulatory role of local government institutions (Union 
Parishads and Pourashavas) who will be supported to develop, enact, and implement their 
own by-laws on water management issues
* Ensure citizen and LGI adherence to reducing over-abstraction and water pollution, reusing 
water (conjunctive use); recycling (waste) water; and restoring water safety (also referred to as 
4 Rs).
* Accord primacy to asset owners’ technology choice with regard to water related assets 
respective the given regulatory framework. 
* Support the strengthening of sub-national institutional mechanisms (LGIs/pourashavas, 
Upazila, line departments, etc.) so that there is greater coordination between them with y view 
to improve water governance and water management practices
* Support citizens’ engagement in IWRM governance and IWRM related models and practices
