abstract: Livelihood in agro-based Barind area in northwest Bangladesh is at
  risk due to moderate-extreme drought impacts. Assessment of water governance
  status is carried out considering the blue water footprint (WF). Here, the
  cropping pattern is dominated by rice and the majority of the farmers use
  groundwater for irrigation. Among crop varieties, Boro rice accounts for the
  highest WF (3109 l/kg) consuming 70% of water with little economic return, and
  all crops exceed global WF standards. The performance indicators like
  transparency, accountability, participation, social equity, environmental
  integrity, efficiency and effectiveness of government organizations (BMDA,
  BWDB, DPHE and LGED) and NGOs (DASCOH Foundation) show that the performance of
  DASCOH Foundation was ‘good’; BMDA and LGED ‘moderate’; while BWDB and DPHE
  ‘bad’, and should take rigorous action plans for scaling up in these issues.
  DASCOH Foundation has started to institutionalize IWRM, updating water laws
  etc. So, appropriate strategies for governance performance due to sustainable
  resource management should be given priority with enabling environment,
  institutions, and instruments.
